# HTTP server kata

A demonstration of how to build an http server

* [ ] What does the browser say?
* [ ] What does the server say?
* [ ] Structure the server to be testable
* [ ] Unit test: A totally empty server
* [ ] Unit test: Responding with a file
* [ ] Demo: Responding with a file
* [ ] Unit test: Responding more than once
* [ ] Demo: Logging in and showing the user
* [ ] Unit test: 401 if there's no cookie
* [ ] Unit test: Respond with name if there is a cookie
* [ ] Demo: Setting the cookie in the development tools (and logging out)
* [ ] Unit test: Setting the cookie
* [ ] Demo: Logging in and showing the user

### Obvious flaws

* [ ] Smart: Refactor http server with new methods
* [ ] Fatal: respond to dir requests with welcome-files (instead of crashing!)
* [ ] Fatal: don't crash on binary files
* [ ] Fatal: don't serve files outside of the contentRoot
* [ ] Critical: Decode more than one form parameter
* [ ] Critical: Support having more than one cookie in the browser
* [ ] Serious: URL encoding (including UTF-8)
* [ ] Useful: Redirect after login
